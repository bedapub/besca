BESCApe - tutorial on deconvolution of bulk RNA using single-cell annotations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

BESCApe (BESCA proportion estimator) is a deconvolution module. It utilises single-cell annotations coming from the BESCA workflow to build a Gene Expression Profile (GEP). This GEP is used as a basis vector to deconvolute bulk RNA samples i.e. predict cell type proportions within a sample.

BESCApe has a useful implementation, whereby the user can specify their own GEP, as well as choose any of the supported deconvolution methods. Thus, BESCApe effectively allows decoupling of the deconvolution algorithm from its underlying GEP (basis vector).

This tutorial will show you the workflow for deconvolution, as well as the link to BESCA single-cell annotations.
